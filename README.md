# Essay.lt
This is a project made by Me and Skaumenas.
I mostly did all the work on the front-end while he worked on the back-end.

This project is an integrated ChatGpt bot and adjusted so it can help students overcome their homework assigments. It can create different stuff from Cover Letters, essays, to solving math problems. Just in otherwords anything to do with homework.
We adjusted the chatgpt to only answer Lithuanian questions since the website is made for people living in Lithuania.

While it may not sound huge, we made this project from scratch with zero Web development experience! We will continue on growing while creating otherprojects.

The hardest things we included in this project were:
Sign in forms
Contact forms
Payments
Plans for each customer
Responsive for all users
